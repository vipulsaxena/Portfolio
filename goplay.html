                  <p>GoPlay is a OTT platform by GoJek(Indonesian SuperApp with 21+products) which is publicly available to download in whole of Indonesia. The service boasts of an array of exclusive movies and TV shows, including Indonesia‘s 2019 Academy Awards nominee Memories of My Body which was co-financed via an in-house studio the company started in 2018. It also partnered with US media outlet Vice to collaborate on original content.</p>

                  <h2>My Role & Process</h2>
                  </br>
                  <p> I joined GoPlay at its MVP stage as Product design lead overlooking design across all GoPlay platforms. I managed 2 designers(UX in IC role) directly while I was collaborating with researchers, Writers and Illustrators from the respective Central teams. Engineering running themselves in 3-week sprints, I ensured that Designs are being tested and delivered at-least 1 sprint ahead for us to then continuously track.

                  <p>At Gojek, we have a standard process that's flexible dpending on the type of product and team.

                  <h2>Lets get a few things right 1st</h2>
                  <p>So GoPlay at its MVP stage lacked multiple things including- documentation, IA maps, Flows, Wireframes and wasn't  compliant to the <a target="none" href="https://asphalt.gojek.io/">Ashpalt(now Aloha)</a> design language system. Once all the potential work was estimated, it was clear enough that its not a solo designers job to maintain design across 3 platforms. That's when we made our 1st hire and kept it scaling as the product grew.
                  </p>
                  <p>And here it begins- I started with embedding task management tools like Asana, Documenting design decisions on confluence, reviews, newsletters, etc. I also used the technical flow diagrams from dev teams to deisgn User-flows and Information architecture, using this I also created wireframes of the MVP to further iterate on. And lastly the DLS work- Theming existing light DLS to Dark mode with GoPlay's hot-pink color scheme, making typography compatible and converting essential components to dark-mode for mobile and web</p>

While she socialises, it's often that everyone talks about their favourite show they currently watching. She cook’s her own food and enjoys watching show’s that interests her, often times recommended by friends.

                  <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
                  </br>
                  <p>GoPlay MVP was created based on business requirement without considering insights from the end-user making it very hard to use. As a result the task performed by users are time consuming and unnecessarily prolonged.
                  </p>
                  </br>
                  <b>Problem statement 🤔</b>
                  <p>The search for relevant content is often a failure and is an unfortunate consequence of bad content discovery experiences.
                  </p>
                  </br>
                  <b>The Solution 💡</b>
                  <p>Apply an evidence-based methodology that involves end-users throughout the design process in order to design a solution that delights user.</p>
                  </br>
                  </br>
                  <h2>Initial Research</h2>
                  </br>
                  <p>Goal was to inform Product, Content and Market strategy post MVP launch Listening and understanding our users aspiration from their feedback to get some clue about their preferences and perception about GoPlay. We did competitive analysis, user-interviews, run survey, captured user feedbacks from social media and App Stores to collect quantitative and qualitative data.</br>

                  <b>Some Key findings</b></br></br>
                  <p>
                     <i>Browsing is a key (often overlooked) component of content discovery:</i> Consumers spend, on average, 42% of their time browsing through content because they don’t know what they want to watch. 37% of respondents say they don’t want to waste their time on starting a new show. Users tend to primarily(IF) continue watching what they have left. 
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     <i>Personalised recommendations are not top-of-mind and often not trusted:</i> 60% of respondents believe personalized recommendations reflect shows the service is trying to promote, not necessarily shows they think they’ll like. 
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     <i>Don’t just tell me “what.” Tell my “why.”</i> Consumers are smart. Today’s audience wants to understand the “why” behind the what. Why does the show have a high rating? What are critics saying? How likely am I to enjoy this show? How did others like me rate it? Also the existing IA may not be the best way to represent details of catalog that would promote most users to watch content.
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     <u>Patience has dwindled:</u> 74% of respondents know within a few seconds if they’ll like a piece of content. Shorter trailers are preferred since it makes them curious about the episode.
                     </br>
                  </p>
                  </br>
                  </br>
                  <h2>Ideation and Prioritisation</h2>
                  </br>
                  <p>With all the research in hand now its time for synthesis and prioratisation. Applying design thinking framework here, to identify multiple HMW's and run them through a prioratisation framework of- Desirability, feasibility and profitability as deciding factors.</p>

                  <p>The card sorting exercise gave us most preferred category to item mapping along with their order of item priority w.r.t each users preference. We then mapped similarity matrix to understand the most suited average of cumulative preferences.
