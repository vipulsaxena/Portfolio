                   <h2>My Role & Process</h2></br>
                   <p> I joined GoPlay at its MVP stage as Product design lead overlooking design across all GoPlay platforms. I managed 2 IC designers directly under me while collaborating with researchers and writers from the Central teams. Engineering running themselves in 3-week sprints, I ensured that Designs are being tested and delivered at-least 1 sprint ahead.
                   </p>

                   <p>A little about process- At gojek we the design team had our standard design process that must be followed by all product designers. It was flexible for each teams to iterate the process in their own requirements and was themed around the 4 Eyes: Impactful, Inclusive, Intuitive and Iterative.
                   </p>

                   </br>
                   
                   <h2>Lets get a few things right 1st</h2>
                   <p>So GoPlay at its MVP stage lacked documentation, IA maps, Flows, Wireframes and wasn't  complient to the Gojek's Ashpalt DLS. Some early wireframes and high level visual designs was all. Once all the future work was estimated it was clear enough that its not a solo designers job to maintain 3 platforms. That's when I made our 1st hire and kept it scaling as the product grew while foarming a bridge between central UX writing team, Creative team and the Motion design team.
                  </p>
                  <p>And here it begins- I started with embedding task management tools like JIRA and Asana, Documenting design decisions, reviews, newsletters, etc on confluence. Then Converted tech flow diagrams to folow maps and IA, mapped out all flows for various scenarios and created wireframes. And lastly the Asphalt - Dark ie; Theming existing light DLS to Dark mode with GoPlay's hot-pink color scheme.</p>

                   <h2>Design Challenge</h2></br>
                   <p>GoPlay MVP was created based on business requirement without considering insights from the end-user making it very hard to use. As a result the task performed by users are time consuming and unnecessarily prolonged.
                   </p>

                   </br>
                   <b>Problem statement 🤔</b>
                   <p>The search for relevant content is often a failure and is an unfortunate consequence of bad content discovery experiences.
                   </p>
                   </br>

                   <b>The Solution 💡</b>
                   <p>Apply an evidence-based methodology that involves end-users throughout the design process in order to design a solution that delights user.</p>
                   </br>
                   </br>

                   <h2>Initial Research</h2></br>
                   <p>Goal was to inform Product, Content and Market strategy post MVP launch Listening and understanding our users aspiration from their feedback to get some clue about their preferences and perception about GoPlay. I did competitive analysis, user-interviews, run survey, captured user feedbacks from social media and App Stores to collect the bellow data.</br>

                   <b>Some Key findings</b></br></br>
                   <p>
                     <i>Browsing is a key (often overlooked) component of content discovery:</i> Consumers spend, on average, 42% of their time browsing through content because they don’t know what they want to watch. 37% of respondents say they don’t want to waste their time on starting a new show. Users tend to primarily(IF) continue watching what they have left. 
                   </br>
                   </br>

                     <i>Personalised recommendations are not top-of-mind and often not trusted:</i> 60% of respondents believe personalized recommendations reflect shows the service is trying to promote, not necessarily shows they think they’ll like. 
                   </br>
                   </br>

                     <i>Don’t just tell me “what.” Tell my “why.”</i> Consumers are smart. Today’s audience wants to understand the “why” behind the what. Why does the show have a high rating? What are critics saying? How likely am I to enjoy this show? How did others like me rate it? Also the existing IA may not be the best way to represent details of catalog that would promote most users to watch content.
                   </br>
                   </br>

                     <u>Patience has dwindled:</u> 74% of respondents know within a few seconds if they’ll like a piece of content. Shorter trailers are preferred since it makes them curious about the episode.
                   </br>
                   </p>
                   </br>
                   </br>

                   <h2>Ideation and Prioritisation</h2></br>
                   <p>With all the research in hand now its time for analysis and synthesis. Using IDEO’s design thinking framework here to generate multiple problems users are currently facing and run them through a prioratisation framework with Desirability, feasibility and profitability deciding factor.</p>

                         <p>I created multiple variation of the details page & ran it through design reviews and usability test to conclude what layout suited GoPlay the best. It was alternative #4 that passed the usability test & was loved the most by co-designers during design-review. But information hierarchy was still an open question.</p>

                      <p>Now to understand what information hierarchy is best suited for the users, I sent out an online hybrid card sorting exercise to a total This being a qualitative research I requested our participants to take a minimum 10/15 minutes out of their schedules and do this exercise being 100% true. I Made sure this pool of users have watched at least one movie and one series on any streaming apps in the past 1 month.</p>

                        <p>The card sorting exercise gave us most preferred category to item mapping along with their order of item priority w.r.t each users preference. I then mapped similarity matrix to understand the most suited average of cumulative preferences.
